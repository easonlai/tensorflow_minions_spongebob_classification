# Tensorflow Minions Spongebob Classification

This is demostration of building Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify Minions & Spongebob images with Tensorflow. After model preparation, export and package it as Tensorflow Serve (TF Serve) compatible format. Model training performance telemetry data will be push to Azure Machine Learning (AML) for tracking and monitoring purpose.
